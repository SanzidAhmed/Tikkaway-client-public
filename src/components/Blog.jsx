                <h1 className='text-2xl'>What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?</h1>
                <p>Custom React JS hooks are reusable functions that a React JS software developer can use to add special and unique functionality to the React applications. Usually, if there is a requirement to add a feature, one can install a third-party library and solve the problem. But what if there is no such library with hooks that can be used? This problem is solved by using custom React JS hooks.</p>
